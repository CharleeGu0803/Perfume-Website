     <!--Reflection of constructing this website-->

		<h2>Website Development Reflection</h2>
		<hr>
		<div class="point">
            <h3>1. Call to Action (CTA) Buttons</h3>
            <p>
                In the initial design phase, I didn't allocate sufficient CTA (Call to Action) buttons for users to click. This led to confusion later on when I had to decide where to place them, impacting the overall user experience. If I had foreseen this, I would have planned the positions and number of CTA buttons from the beginning, ensuring they could guide users towards the desired actions and improve conversion rates.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="point">
            <h3>2. Responsive Design</h3>
            <p>
                Throughout the design process, I realized that responsive design is far more important than I initially anticipated. Initially, I didn't fully adhere to the "mobile-first" principle, which caused difficulties when adapting the website for different devices later on. If I had realized the importance of considering the mobile display during the design phase, I would have adopted more flexible layouts and styles from the start, avoiding extensive modifications and debugging later. This would not only improve development efficiency but also ensure a consistent user experience across various devices.

        </div>
        <div class="point">
            <h3>3. Naming Conventions</h3>
            <p>
                During the development process, I overlooked some basic naming conventions, such as not including spaces in image names referenced in HTML. This oversight resulted in a lot of modifications during code validation, adding unnecessary workload. If I had known and adhered to these naming rules from the start, I would have standardized naming conventions early on, reducing the need for later changes and improving development efficiency.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="point">
            <h3>4. Website Accessibility</h3>
            <p>
                Website accessibility was another important aspect I gradually became aware of during the design process. Initially, I focused mainly on visual effects and functional implementation, neglecting considerations for visually impaired users. Through repeated testing and user feedback, I realized that adding appropriate accessibility features, such as screen reader support and keyboard navigation, is crucial for ensuring all users can smoothly access the website. If I had known about these best practices earlier, I would have incorporated these features at the early stages of the project, rather than adjusting them later. This would not only enhance the website's inclusivity but also meet the needs of more users and improve user satisfaction.
            </p>
        </div>
        <p>
            These reflections made me deeply aware of the importance of anticipating user experience and technical details at every stage of website design and development. In the future, I will conduct more comprehensive planning in the early stages of projects to avoid similar issues and continuously improve my skills in website development.
